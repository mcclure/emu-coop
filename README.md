This directory contains some Lua scripts that, when loaded by a compliant emulator such as snes9x-rr or FCEUX, can synchronize emulator state over the internet (allowing "cooperative" playthroughs of single-player games).

Each game you want to use this with requires a "mode" file in the modes/ directory. Currently included are modes for Link to the Past, the Link to the Past "Randomizer", Zelda 1 and Super Metroid. **WARNING: Modes are PROGRAMS, like a .exe file. Do not install a mode file unless it came from someone you know and trust.** 

You can find a guide on how to use these scripts at <https://goo.gl/CSkF4x>.

You can reach me, FirenX, here at GitHub or at Discord as Feed4Fame#7342.
